•	Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
The project I worked on was the Pirate Intelligent Agent. It could move in an 8 x 8 matrix with a range of cells (free, occupied, target). The IA would be given rewards and penalties to score each run and improve. There were certain parameters like Exploration factor and Epsilon that could be changed to try and maximize the AIs potential. With the provided code we created the Q-Training Algorithm Code Block. 

•	What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer Scientists write and analysis the code to improve its design so that process can be accelerated in all kinds of different fields and environments. By doing this in multiple ways the world will continue to advance technological.

•	How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
You need to approach a problem open mindedly and look at the problem from every aspect. Where does the code come from and how does it affect where it’s going. 

•	What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
That the AI only collects data through ethical and lawful means.
